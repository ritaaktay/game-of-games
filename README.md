# A Game of Games

### [PLAY](https://cookie-monster-game-of-games.herokuapp.com/)

- A front-end game that runs in the browser - move around with your keyboard to win mini games and escape the cookie monster!
- Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS on a custom game engine.
- [Read a blog post on how I designed a solution for this game engine with dependency injections](https://medium.com/@rita.aktay/a-game-engine-building-a-dependency-injection-container-27905b2a10ff)
